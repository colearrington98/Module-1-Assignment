Updated Site for Horiseon Social Solutions.
Displays company and describes company services and the benefits.

Updated and refactored code enough not to change or effect how the original image looked or how the site runned.
Made it more accessible for the user and easer to navigate to from a search engine. 
Updated "Title" to the company name so it would read the "Horiseon" on the taskbar.
Removed any CSS Selectors or elements that were not being used or uneseccary.
